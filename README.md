## üîç Project Overview

**The Lost** is a Pygame game where you explore a vast maze from a top-down perspective, featuring a safe central area inspired by *The Maze Runner* film.

Our goal is to deliver an **immersive and engaging experience** where every interaction and challenge brings you closer to finding your way out of this world.

Game development is streamlined thanks to the integration of a dedicated map editor (`Conceptor.py`).
